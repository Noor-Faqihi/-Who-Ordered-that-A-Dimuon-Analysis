# "Who Ordered this?": A Dimuon Analysis 
In the 1930s, Physicists thought that they knew all the subatomic particles out there. However, in 1936 an unexpected particle was discovered. The electron's heavier cousin: the muon. This project aims to study the characteristics of muons from the Double Muon 2011 Run.
